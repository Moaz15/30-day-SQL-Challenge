Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.
Unlike aggregate functions (e.g., SUM(), AVG()), window functions do not collapse rows â€” 
they retain all rows and provide additional computed columns.
They are used with the OVER() clause, which defines the window (i.e., the range of rows) 
the function should operate on.

<function_name>(expression) OVER (
    PARTITION BY column1
    ORDER BY column2
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)

1. Ranking Functions 

| Function       | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ROW_NUMBER()` | Unique sequential number to each row        |
| `RANK()`       | Same rank for ties, with gaps               |
| `DENSE_RANK()` | Same rank for ties, no gaps                 |
| `NTILE(n)`     | Divides rows into `n` roughly equal buckets |


2. ðŸ“ˆ Value Functions

| Function        | Description                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `LAG()`         | Gets value from a previous row |
| `LEAD()`        | Gets value from a next row     |
| `FIRST_VALUE()` | First value in window frame    |
| `LAST_VALUE()`  | Last value in window frame     |
| `NTH_VALUE(n)`  | N-th value in the window       |


3. ðŸ§® Aggregate Functions as Window Functions

| Function          | Description                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `SUM()`           | Running or partitioned total |
| `AVG()`           | Average within the window    |
| `MIN()` / `MAX()` | Min/Max in the window        |
| `COUNT()`         | Row count in the window      |
